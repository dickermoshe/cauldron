Sugar doesn't hold some grandiose vision for dramatically changing programming. It just contains simple, quality of life improvements.

To add the library to your project:
```bash
dart pub add sugar 
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  sugar: ^3.0.0
```

## Design Philosophy
* Follow Dart's core library's design where applicable
* Minimal 3rd-party dependencies
* Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible
