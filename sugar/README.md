Sugar is an extension to Dart's standard library. It provides the following (and much more!):
* Date-time & timezone library inspired by Java's [`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html) package.
* Monads such as `Result<S,F>` & `Maybe<T>`.
* Syntax sugar for aggregating & manipulating collections.
* Types for representing and working with ranges & intervals.
