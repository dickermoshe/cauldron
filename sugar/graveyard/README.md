## Graveyard

This folder contains ideas & features that we originally envisioned to be useful but could not be implemented properly or
lacked enough utility to warrant inclusion when brainstorming/prototyping. It also documents failed attempts at designing
parts of the current library, i.e. "Why didn't we do X instead?".

Such ideas are included along with a brief description of why or how it failed for posterity.
